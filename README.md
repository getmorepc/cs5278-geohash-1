# Overview

This programming assignment will exercise your non-OO Java programming
skills. For those new to Java, this exercise may be very difficult. 

It is OK if this assignment is difficult. Please put in your best effort.

The topics that you will cover in this assignment are:

  1. Recursion
  2. Implementation of an algorithm from a spec
  3. Java arrays
  4. Use of Java system libraries
  
There is an expectation that your programming skills are at a level that
you can pick up new programming languages independently. This assignment
is a very simple initial Java program. If you are new to Java and struggle 
with this assignment, you should:
   1. Reach out to the instructor(s) to let them know
   2. Work through the official Java Tutorial by Oracle:
      https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/
   3. Look at the next three assignments
   4. Assess if you need to hold off on taking this class and take
      time coming up to speed on Java instead

Tip: Commit and push to your repository frequently so that the instructor
can see your incremental work. Particularly for people that struggle 
with the assignment, lots of commits will show the effort that you put
in and raise your score. 

## Running the Tests

The tests for the assignment are contained in the edu.vanderbilt.cs.GeoHashTest
class. You can run this class as a JUnit test in your IDE or from the 
command line using "gradle test". Every time that you commit and push
to GitHub, GitHub Actions will compile and test your code. You can 
view the results on the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository.

## Grading 

If you don't complete the assignment or your implementation has bugs, you
still need to turn in  your partial / broken implementation to receive
feedback. However, you should make sure that your work compiles. 

Grading process:
   1. If you have a working implementation that passes all tests, you 
      will receive a 100
   2. If you have a broken / incomplete implementation, your grade will
      be based on the number of tests that your code passes and the
      overall code quality.
   3. You may receive a pull request with code comments specifying
      aspects of your solution that you need to improve.
   4. If you receive comments, you will need to address the comments
      and commit the updated version within a week of receiving the
      comments.
   5. You may receive multiple rounds of comments before receiving a
      grade.
  
   
What to do:
   1. See the edu.vanderbilt.cs.live2.GeoHash class for instructions
   2. When your implementation is complete, make sure the most up
      to date version is committed and pushed to your assignment
      repository.
      
Warning! There may be typos, bugs, or other issues with the assignment.
If you encounter a bug, typo, etc., please post to the course discussion
forum to let the instructor know.
